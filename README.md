# SmartFS

A smart multi-optioned file system written in C with Linux LibFUSE. Designed to be efficient, understandable, and easy to use. 

Current options:

1. Versioning file system (keeps old versions of documents and accesses the newest one â€” convenient and easy to revert changes.)
2. Caesar file system (file system with built-in basic Caesar cypher encryption capabilities with text)
3. Mirror file system (kept for test purposes - replicates actions of another directory)
